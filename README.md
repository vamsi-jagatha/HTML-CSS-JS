**Description:**

This repository is a record of my journey through 100 days of web development. I will be creating a new web development project every single day for 100 days straight! The goal is to push myself, learn new skills, and build a portfolio of projects showcasing my abilities. Projects will vary in complexity, focusing on different aspects of web development like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.Feel free to follow my progress and see the daily projects evolve. I'm open to suggestions and feedback, so don't hesitate to leave comments or create issues for any project.If you're also interested in web development and want to collaborate on a project during this challenge, feel free to reach out!I'm excited to embark on this challenge and share my progress with the world.
